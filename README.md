With Fogbugz switching from free to monthly charge, thought a simple bug tracker could fill all needs.

Saved all Fogbugz bugs as Microsoft Word docs. Plan to import them either straight from Word or from a .txt file.

First step was to get abhixsmasher version to run on Visual Studio 2022. Left the .sln project in github in Visual Studio 2017 (I think); then added some features and comments to make easier. 

Separated data into Data Folder. Set up to look like this:
    Bug-Tracker folder
        Data subfolder
        Bin subfolder
        
 That is where it stands now.
